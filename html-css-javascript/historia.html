                        Japan and Montenegro were technically at war for 101 years. The war officially ended in 2006.

                    Yep, you read that right. See, in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904â€“05 between Japan and Russia, Montenegro decided to side with Russia. The conflict ended after about a year, but Montenegro did not participate in the peace talks conducted by US President Theodore Roosevelt. So technically, while Japan, Russia, and all the other involved countries signed a peace treaty, Montenegro remained "at war" with Japan, at least on paper.

                Later, in 1919, Montenegro became part of what would become known as Yugoslavia, and didn't become an officially recognized sovereign nation of its own until 2006. Since the country never technically declared peace, one of its first acts as a newly independent nation was to sign a peace treaty with Japan...101 years after the war started.
